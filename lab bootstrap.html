			<div class="col" style="background-color: pink"><p>The development of cisplatin as an anticancer medicine lit fire in the field of bioinorganic chemistry. Platinum being one of the well-known agents with anti-tumour properties have served the interests of researchers even though severe toxicities and drug resistance issues prevent its usage in clinical settings. In order to increase clinical effectiveness, decrease general toxicity, and widen the spectrum of activity, research and development of innovative metal-based anticancer medicines are accelerating and Copper proves to be a promising metal in the field of anticancer drug development since, trace metal is involved in several biological activities such as in redox chemistry, growth, and development, required for the operation of a number of enzymes and proteins involved in energy metabolism, respiration, and DNA synthesis, including cytochrome oxidase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate oxidase, and tyrosinase. Copper-biological compound's primary functions entail oxidation-reduction reactions in which copper-containing biological molecules react directly with molecular oxygen to form free radicals.</p></div>
